# Lingkod: "The Analysis of Exam Performance by Students"

## INTRODUCTION
Tests and examinations are part of the evaluation and assessment process that is used to fulfill academic requirements. They are efficient techniques for evaluating individual social change that are connected to successful educating and learning exercises. A test question is an appraisal apparatus used to assemble data on an understudy's mental, psychomotor, and full of feeling accomplishment. Tests and appraisals are utilized to fill a significant need: to mirror understudies' accomplishment and to recognize capable understudies from novices. This is useful for categorizing students based on their skill and capability. The examination item is an important tool for reflecting students' achievements and distinguishing proficient students from amateurs. This is beneficial for categorizing students based on their skill and capability. The examination item is an important tool for reflecting students' achievements and distinguishing skilled students from novices. To provide a systematic approach of assessing students' abilities, the lack of guidelines on verifying the reliability and validity of examination items must be addressed. The student's exam performance will be analyzed by researchers. This will carry out an assessment and evaluation for a student at a college in the United States. The data acquired from the student's final examination will be analyzed and checked to see how the class performed in each topic. Education is viewed as an instrument for change, and change is occurring at a faster rate than in past generations. High-quality education may assure a country's future, welfare, and prosperity. Curriculum, students, teachers, instructional methods, leadership, administration, assessment, and interactions with other apex organizations are all utilized to assess educational quality.


## STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
Today, Teachers measure understudies' acquired information progress through appraisal and assessment, yet course grades are vigorously weighted by assessment scores. To graduate, understudies are feeling the squeeze to perform well under these circumstances.  In order to attain excellent exam scores, students’ study in accordance to this. Exam styles and student study strategies vary greatly. However, researchers have not decided if explicit review methodologies are participated because of a given test design. Accordingly, this other arrangement paper will zero in basically on past examination concentrates on that have focused on gathering data of the understudy execution or progress, and utilization of the packing concentrate on system among understudies' populace. Assessment and evaluating format identify the student’s issues as well as their program flaws and preferences, assessment and evaluating performance study strategy approaches and influences will be explained throughout the comprehensive literature review. The review goes on with an outline of accessible examination and suggestions for additional exploration.

## SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT
Assessment and evaluation are critical tools for tailoring curriculum and instructional techniques to the needs of students, as well as measuring the overall efficacy of programs and classroom activities.The information acquired via assessments and evaluations assists teachers in identifying students' issues as well as program flaws. Assessment is the process of obtaining information from many sources that correctly reflects how well students are meeting curricular requirements. The process of analyzing the quality of student work against set standards and providing a value to indicate that quality is referred to as evaluation. The purpose of assessment is to gather meaningful information about a student's performance or progress, or to determine a student's interests so that decisions may be made about their learning process. Assessment data assists teachers in determining students' strengths and shortcomings, as well as their general grasp of course material. An evaluation assists educators in adjusting their teaching approaches to ensure the maximum amount of effective learning for each student. The information acquired via assessments and evaluations assists teachers in identifying students' issues as well as program flaws.Teachers offer detailed feedback to students as part of the evaluation process to direct their efforts toward development.

## METHODS
The information that were acquired from the last assessment of understudy in US school. This study was directed for every one of the 1000 understudies who have enrolled to the course. The inspiration driving the audit is to assess students’ practical grades.
Since one of the study's results is a prediction model, the research design included linear regression analysis. Hypothesis testing is also possible with this design type. The research question guided the technique choices. The methods used will differ based on the learning outcomes to be assessed. Students use direct techniques to demonstrate that they have attained a learning goal or target. Indirect approaches are used when students or others share their perceptions of how successfully students have accomplished a goal or outcome. Select standardized assessments that are connected with the learning outcomes of your specific program. Data should be scored, compiled, and analyzed. Create local norms to track achievement over time, and use national norms to compare your students to those on other campuses.
## EXPECTED OUPUT
Researchers will examine the class's performance in each topic, the effect of parent education level on student performance, and the relationship involving Gender and Student performance.

## Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the Project:

These SDGs are further described as follows;

  Goal 4 - this goal aiming to ensure that all students receive a high-quality education that is inclusive and equitable, and encourage lifelong learning opportunities.
