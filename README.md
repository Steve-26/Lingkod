# Lingkod: "The Analysis of Exam Performance by Students"

## INTRODUCTION
Tests and examinations are part of the evaluation and assessment process that is used to fulfill academic requirements. They are systematic methods for assessing individual behavioral change that are linked to effective teaching and learning activities. A test question is an assessment tool used to gather information on a student's cognitive, psychomotor, and affective achievement. Tests and assessments are used to serve an important purpose: to reflect students' achievement and to distinguish proficient students from amateurs. This is useful for categorizing students based on their skill and capability. The examination item is an important tool for reflecting students' achievements and distinguishing proficient students from amateurs.This is beneficial for categorizing students based on their skill and capability. The examination item is an important tool for reflecting students' achievements and distinguishing skilled students from novices. To provide a systematic approach of assessing students' abilities, the lack of guidelines on verifying the reliability and validity of examination items must be addressed. The student's exam performance will be analyzed by researchers. This will carry out an assessment and evaluation for a student at a college in the United States. The data acquired from the student's final examination will be analyzed and checked to see how the class performed in each topic. Education is viewed as an instrument for change, and change is occurring at a faster rate than in past generations.High-quality education may assure a country's future, welfare, and prosperity. Curriculum, students, teachers, instructional methods, leadership, administration, assessment, and interactions with other apex organizations are all utilized to assess educational quality.


## STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
Today, Teachers measure students’ obtained knowledge progress through assessment and evaluation, yet course grades are heavily weighted by examination scores. Students are pressured to perform well under these conditions in order to graduate. Studying is employed in response to this to achieve high examination scores. Exam formats and student study strategies are widely varied. Yet, researchers have not determined whether specific study strategies are engaged in response to a given exam format. Therefore, this alternate plan paper will focus primarily on previous research studies that have concentrated on collecting information of the student performance or progress, and usage of the cramming study strategy amongst students’ population. Assessment and evaluating format identify the student’s issues as well as their program flaws and preferences, assessment and evaluating performance study strategy approaches and influences will be explained throughout the comprehensive literature review. The review concludes with a summary of the existing research followed by future research recommendations.


## SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT
Assessment and evaluation are critical tools for tailoring curriculum and instructional techniques to the needs of students, as well as measuring the overall efficacy of programs and classroom activities.The information acquired via assessments and evaluations assists teachers in identifying students' issues as well as program flaws. Assessment is the process of obtaining information from many sources that correctly reflects how well students are meeting curricular requirements. The process of analyzing the quality of student work against set standards and providing a value to indicate that quality is referred to as evaluation.
The goal of assessment is to collect useful information on student performance or progress, or to establish student interests in order to make decisions regarding their learning process. Assessment data assists teachers in determining students' strengths and shortcomings, as well as their general grasp of course material. An evaluation assists educators in adjusting their teaching approaches to ensure the maximum amount of effective learning for each student.  The information acquired via assessments and evaluations assists teachers in identifying students' issues as well as program flaws.Teachers offer detailed feedback to students as part of the evaluation process to direct their efforts toward development.


## METHODS
The data that were obtained from the final examination of student in united states college. This study was conducted for all 1001 students who have registered to the course. The purpose of the study is to examine students practical exam scores. As one of the outcomes from this study is a predictive model, 
the research design utilized linear regression analysis. This design type also allows for 
hypothesis testing. The methodology selection was driven by the research question. Methods will vary depending on the learning outcomes to be measured.  Direct methods are when students demonstrate that they have achieved a learning outcome or objective.  Indirect methods are when students or others report perceptions of how well students have achieved an objective or outcome. elect standardized tests that are aligned to your specific program learning outcomes. Score, compile, and analyze data. Develop local norms to track achievement across time and use national norms to see how your students compare to those on other campuses.

## EXPECTED OUPUT
Researchers will be checking out the performance of the class in each subject, the effect of parent level of education on the student performance, and also the relationship between Gender and Student performance.
